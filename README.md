Project Introduction: Improving Machine Efficiency and Maintenance at Sandhar Technologies Ltd

Project Overview: At Sandhar Technologies Ltd, a leading manufacturing company, we embarked on a 
comprehensive project to enhance the efficiency and reliability of our 17 different machines. 
This project aimed to improve Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), streamline preventive maintenance processes,
and minimize downtime and breakdown costs, all while ensuring data quality. The entire project was executed using 
Power BI with SQL integration, providing a robust and efficient data analysis and reporting solution.

Objectives:
Enhance Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE):
Measure and track OEE to identify areas for improvement.
Implement strategies to optimize machine performance an productivity.
Implement Preventive Maintenance:
Develop a preventive maintenance schedule to reduce unplanned downtime.
Monitor maintenance activities to ensure timely execution and effectiveness.
Minimize Downtime and Breakdown Costs:
Identify and analyze the root causes of machine downtime and breakdowns.
Implement corrective actions to reduce the frequency and duration of downtime.

Ensure Data Quality:

Integrate data from various sources into a centralized database using SQL.
Ensure the accuracy, consistency, and completeness of data for reliable analysis and reporting.

Solution Implementation:

Data Integration and Management:
SQL Integration: Utilized SQL to integrate data from various machine sensors, maintenance logs, and production records into a centralized database. This allowed for seamless data management and accessibility.
Data Cleaning: Employed data cleaning techniques to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure data consistency, enhancing overall data quality.

OEE Tracking and Analysis:

OEE Calculation: Developed a comprehensive OEE calculation model in Power BI, considering availability, performance, and quality metrics for each machine.
Dashboard Creation: Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize OEE trends, performance comparisons, and identify bottlenecks
Preventive Maintenance Scheduling:

Maintenance Scheduler: Designed a maintenance scheduling system in Power BI, highlighting upcoming maintenance tasks, due dates, and responsible personnel.
Maintenance Tracking: Monitored and tracked maintenance activities, providing real-time insights into the status and effectiveness of preventive maintenane.
Downtime and Breakdown Analysis
Downtime Tracking: Implemented downtime tracking mechanisms to capture detailed information on machine stoppages, including duration, cause, and impact.
Cost Analysis: Analyzed breakdown costs by correlating downtime data with repair costs, labor expenses, and production losses, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Ensuring Data Quality:

Data Validation: Conducted regular data validation checks to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data inputs.
Data Integration: Leveraged SQL's robust querying capabilities to integrate and aggregate data from multiple sources, ensuring a single source of truth for analysis.

Results:

Increased OEE: Achieved a significant improvement in OEE, leading to higher machine productivity and efficiency.
Reduced Downtime: Minimized unplanned downtime through effective preventive maintenance and root cause analysis.
Cost Savings: Realized substantial cost savings by reducing breakdown costs and optimizing maintenance processes.
Enhanced Data Quality: Ensured high data quality, providing reliable insights for informed decision-making.

Conclusion: This project at Sandhar Technologies Ltd successfully demonstrated the power of integrating Power BI with SQL to enhance machine efficiency, streamline maintenance processes, and ensure data quality. The interactive dashboards and real-time insights enabled data-driven decision-making, contributing to overall operational excellence and cost efficiency.
